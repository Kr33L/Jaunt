# Jaunt
Old C# cmd text adventure game project that was left unfinished. 

The build version is very buggy but if you want to check it out here are the steps:

1. Download `Source code (zip)` from the releases.
2. Navigate to the `Build` folder.
3. Run `Jaunt.exe` file which should open the program inside a command window.

Otherwise, the proper functioning version can be run through the visual studio debugger inside of a classic command prompt.
